# SecureKeyVault

## Overview

SecureKeyVault is a robust and feature-rich password manager designed to provide a secure and unique experience for users. It goes beyond the conventional password manager functionalities, offering advanced features like context-sensitive password generation, biometric encryption, self-destruct functionality, and more.

## Features

### 1. Context-Sensitive Password Generation

SecureKeyVault intelligently generates passwords based on the context of their usage. For example, it can create distinct password patterns for social media platforms, email accounts, or generic services.

### 2. Intelligent Adaptation

The password manager adapts to the security requirements of each website or service, generating passwords with the necessary length, complexity, and additional security features.

### 3. Password Rollback Mechanism

In the event of a compromised password, SecureKeyVault can automatically restore a previous secure password, providing an added layer of protection.

### 4. Biometric Encryption

Integration of biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, enhances the decryption process, adding an extra layer of security.

### 5. Self-Destruction Functionality

In case of suspected unauthorized access, the password manager can initiate a self-destruct sequence, deleting or replacing stored passwords with randomly generated ones.

### 6. Context-Driven Notifications

Receive context-specific notifications about suspicious logins or activities, empowering users to detect and address potential security threats early on.

### 7. Encrypted Notes

SecureKeyVault allows users to store encrypted notes, providing additional information about accounts or passwords that is only visible upon correct authentication.

### 8. Password Strength Assessment

The password manager includes a feature to assess and warn users about the strength of their passwords, encouraging the use of robust and secure credentials.

### 9. Password History

SecureKeyVault maintains a history of previous passwords, preventing users from repeatedly using the same passwords and promoting better security practices.

### 10. Cloud Storage Integration

Enable users to securely store password data in popular cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive, facilitating access from various devices.

### 11. Emergency Access

Implement a secure emergency access feature for trusted contacts, allowing them access in case the user forgets their password or loses access.

### 12. Dark Mode

Enhance user experience by incorporating a dark mode, providing a visually comfortable option for different environments.
